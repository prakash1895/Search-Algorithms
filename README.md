## CS534 AI HW1

1) Navigate to the Project Directory

TO RUN THE CODE:
  python search.py <graph_file_txt> <search_method>

  	There are nine search algorithms:
		depth_first
		breadth_first
		depth_limited
		depth_iterative
		uniform_cost
		greedy
		astar
		beam
		hillclimbing
	
	Example:
		python search.py graph.txt uniform_cost	

	NOTE: In order to run all searches, enter 'ALL' for <search algorithm>

   	      python search.py graph.txt ALL
